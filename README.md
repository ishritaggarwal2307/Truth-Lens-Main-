# 🚨 The Threat Landscape

AI-generated voice deepfakes are enabling:

- Financial fraud & CEO impersonation  
- Social engineering attacks  
- Identity spoofing  
- Disinformation campaigns  
- Manipulated legal evidence  

Traditional systems lack:
- Transparency  
- Reliability scoring  
- Anomaly detection  
- Forensic-grade reporting  

Truth Lens addresses these gaps.

# 💡 Solution Overview

Truth Lens combines:

- 🎙 Deepfake Voice Detection  
- 🧠 Ensemble Machine Learning  
- 🚨 Out-of-Distribution Detection  
- 🔍 Explainable AI (SHAP)  
- 📊 Acoustic Forensic Visualization  
- 📄 Court-Style PDF Report Generation  

This creates a **decision-support intelligence layer**, not a black-box classifier.
